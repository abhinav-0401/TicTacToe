Tackling choice during gameplay:

  Create a loop and a counter variable.

  For even numbered loops, "O" is the playerChoice.
  For odd numbered loops, "X" is the playerChoice.

To play a single round, you need to know the player choice, matrix change, updating the dom and then doing a check if the round's over yet and then returning the bool value.

Okay, as soon as you click an element, a function is called.
  
  This function takes in roundNum, which is defined [somewhere].
